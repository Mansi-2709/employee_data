## Project Description

I have built a machine learning model to predict the Job Satisfaction of the employees given data such as Age, Experience, Workload, Stress, Commute distance, using Decision Tree Algorithm. Employees had to rate their Job Satisfaction level on a scale of 1 to 5. The data has been taken from Kaggle.
